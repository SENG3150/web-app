# web-app

# Requirements
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) not sure if v6 is much different, I am using v4.2

# Installation
After cloning the repository go into the directory and run this command in the terminal:

	
	npm install
	
# Compiling The Application
The application includes [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and a gulpfile which will minimise the stylesheets and javascript to ensure that the application loads quickly for users. To run it just use this command in the terminal, and keep the terminal open and running while you develop the web-app:


	gulp
